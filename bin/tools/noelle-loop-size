# It is not guaranteed that noelle-loopsize receives normalized bitcode

# So, we call a subset of noelle-norm that adds the loop IDs metadata,
# without changing the actual bitcode (i.e., adding/removing instructions),
# which would be incorrect when noelle-loopsize is called in the context of
# noelle-fixedpoint.
