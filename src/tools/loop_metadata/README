This is the template to use for assignments of the Code Analysis and Transformation class at Northwestern

To build: 
  Compile and install your code by invoking ./run_me.sh
  The script run_me.sh compiles and installs an LLVM-based compiler that includes your CAT in the directory ~/CAT

To run:
  1) Add your compiler cat-c in your PATH (i.e., export PATH=~/CAT/bin:$PATH)

  2) Invoke your compiler to compile a C program. For example
    $ cat-c program_to_analyse.c -o mybinary
    $ cat-c -O3 program_to_analyse.c -o mybinary
    $ cat-c -O0 program_to_analyse.bc -o mybinary
