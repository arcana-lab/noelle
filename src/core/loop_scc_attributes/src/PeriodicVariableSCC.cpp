       * We allow PeriodicVariableSCC to include cases that feature a single SCC containing
       * two phis when one of the phis is used only by the other phi.
       * We view this as a single accumulator case where the accumulator is said to be the phi 
       * that has SCC-external users.
       * Calling "getAccumulator" should therefore return specifically the phi that has SCC-external users.
       * The algorithm for determining the accumulator in SingleAccumulatorRecomputableSCC
       * can't deal with picking the phi that has users between the two phis of the 2-phis case.
       * This code therefore handles that special case in conjunction with the analysis code in
       * SCCDAGAttrs.cpp, so that "getAccumulator" will return the correct phi in the 2-phis case.
