   * privatizeCandidate is a global variable that we want to privatize into the
   * current function. "Privatize" means we want to transform the global
   * variable to an AllocaInst in the current function.
   *
   * We use MayPointsToAnalysis::notPrivatizable() to check whether
   * privatizeCandidate can be privatized into the current function. The idea of
   * notPrivatizable() is described as follows.
   *
   * If we want to privatize privatizeCandidate, we must ensure other functions
   * will not access the memory object of privatizeCandidate through pointers.
   * To put it another way, if privatizeCandidate is privatized to an
   * AllocaInst, the AllocaInst shall not escape.
   *
   * Usually, the memory object of one global variable is represented by the
   * "unknown" memory object. Such a conservative strategy will lose the
   * points-to info of the memory object of privatizeCandidate.
   *
   * To handle this issue, we must treat privatizeCandidate in a different way
   * from other global variables. We assign a non-zero NodeID to represent the
   * memory object of privatizeCandidate, just like it's an AllocaInst.
   *
   * If this NodeID may be pointed directly or indirectly by the "unknown"
   * memory object, or the return value of the current function, then we know if
   * privatizeCandidate is privatized to an AllocaInst, this AllocaInst may
   * escape and be accessed after the current function returns.
   *
   * In such a case, privatizing privatizeCandidate may cause undefined
   * behavior, we should give up the privatization and notPrivatizable() will
   * return true. Otherwise, notPrivatizable() will return false.
   *
   * Note notPrivatizable() returning true means we should give up the
   * privatization, while notPrivatizable() returning false only means the
   * AllocaInst transfromed from privatizeCandidate will not escape. The false
   * reult doesn't mean it's safe to privatize the global variable because we
   * must check more things.
